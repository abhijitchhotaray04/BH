        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> October 21, 2025</p>

        <p>Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and the crucial role of the Gemini AI service in generating your resume.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>A. User Input:</strong> We collect the personal and professional data you enter into our conversational form, which includes your name, job title, work experience, education, certifications, and achievements (collectively, "User Input").</p>
        <p><strong>B. Functional Data:</strong> We use essential local storage items (cookies) to save your chosen language preference and to remember if you have acknowledged the cookie banner. We **do not** use tracking, analytics, or advertising cookies.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Processing & AI Disclosure</h2>
        <p><strong>A. Purpose of Collection:</strong> The User Input is collected **solely for the purpose of generating your professional resume** in the language you select.</p>
        <p><strong>B. AI Service Disclosure:</strong> To generate the resume, the User Input is securely transmitted from our serverless proxy to the **Google Gemini API.** You acknowledge and consent to this transfer for the purpose of service delivery.</p>
        <p><strong>C. Data Retention:</strong> **We do not store your User Input data** on our servers or databases. The data is processed in real-time by the Gemini API and is discarded by our system after the generated resume text is returned to your browser.</p>

        <h2>3. Your Responsibilities & Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to know what data we hold (none, as we don't store it) and the right to request erasure. Since we do not retain the User Input, simply closing your browser session effectively deletes the data from our system.</p>

        <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will always be posted here, and the "Effective Date" at the top will be revised.</p>
